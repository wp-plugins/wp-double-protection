This plugin allows a second password option and thus making your website doubly protected.

== Description ==
You can see more, on how to use the plugin here in this blog [WP Double Protection](http://www.sourcexpress.com/wp-double-protection/)

= Plugin's Features: =

* Allow user to use two different password for the website and thus makes the website extra secure.
* Once the plugin is activated and until the user has not set his second password in the user profile, the second password will be same as the first password.
* Once the second password is set from the user profile, the user would now need to enter the corresponding passwords while login.
* To reset the second password the user has to follow the default lost password link and it will reset the second password to the newly chosen main password and then the user would have to again set a different second password from the user profile
